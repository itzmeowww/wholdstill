## What is `Wholdstill` ?

<b>Wholdstill</b> is a content stabilizing software that uses face
detection to determine the user’s relative position and shift the
content on the device accordingly. <b>Wholdstill</b> is written entirely
in Javascript and can be integrated with any website to improve the
user’s experience in any shaky environment. Whether the motion is from
the device, user, or both, the content will move to reduce the relative
motion with the user. Whether reading text while commuting in a car or
watching videos while running on a thread mill. <b>Wholdstill</b> runs
on the users’ browser and, thus, does not require an additional server.
With users’ consent to access their webcam, the software is ready to
make the whole screen stay still.
